## Overview

We set to determine temperature trends during June and December to help W. Avy determine if his surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results

- The mean temperatures between June and December only differ by ~4 degrees.
- The high and low only decrease by 2 and 8 degrees, respectively, in the winter.
- Each quartile drops by about 4 degrees from June to December.

## Summary

Fortunately for W. Avy, there isn't much of a difference when it comes to the temperatures in June and December. I'd like to run another query showing the difference in rainfall between the two months. You could even do that for all the months pretty quickly to see when a spike in precipitation may cause a dip in business. Another query I'd like to perform, if possible, would be determining wind speeds throughout the year because that could determine how active perspective surfers may be.
